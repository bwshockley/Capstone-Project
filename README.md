# Capstone-Project
Capstone project for the Udacity Android nanodegree program - a score keeping application for a "Heck of a Game"

## What is it?
Heck of a Score is an application for score keeping during a game of [Heck of a Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell).
It is setup for a round of 7, starting with 7 tricks and working down towards 1 trick.  Up to 7 players may be added per game, but the application will store information on as many players as you want.
Heck of a Score also keeps tabs on your high scores, average scores, best and worst games.
